# ecg-digitization
Converting ECG waveform images into digital time-series data using computer vision and machine learning.
This project aims to reconstruct digital time-series ECG signals from images of electrocardiogram printouts. The goal is to build a robust pipeline capable of handling real-world ECG images, including scans, mobile photos, and degraded paper records.
This project is inspired by a Kaggle competition but is being developed independently as a portfolio-focused biomedical machine learning project.
